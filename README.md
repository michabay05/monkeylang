# Monkeylang in C

Monkeylang is a programming language implemented in [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) as a means to teach the development of an interpreter. In the book, Monkeylang is implemented in Go, but I have implemented it here in C just as a challenge.

## Quickstart
```sh
$ make repl
$ bin/repl
```
